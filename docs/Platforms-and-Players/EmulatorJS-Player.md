[EmulatorJS](https://emulatorjs.org/) is a web-based emulator for various system; that is, it allows you to run old games in your web browser. It's based on [`Emscripten`](https://emscripten.org/), which is a toolchain for compiling C and C++ code to WebAssembly.

!!! warning
    Due to a [change by Apple in iOS 18.2](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=284752), emulation is severely limited, and likely non-functional, on iOS devices.

!!! warning
    PSP emulation with the PPSSPP core requires [special setup with a reverse proxy](https://emulatorjs.org/docs/options#ejs_threads), or launching Chrome browser with the `--disable-web-security` and `--enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer` flags, which WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE as it disables important security features.

!!! warning
    Emulation is a complex and resource-intensive process. As such, it may not work well in all browser, especially older or less powerful ones. If you're having trouble running a game, try using a different browser or device.

### Loading saves and states

Our integration with EmulatorJS automates the process of loading and saving save files and save states. Before starting the game, select a save and/or state file to load (if one is available). Anytime you save the game (or create a save state), the save and state files stored with RomM will be updated, so there's no need to manually download or upload them.
