## IGDB

To access the IGDB API you'll need a Twitch account and a valid phone number for 2FA verification. Up-to-date instructions are available in the [IGDB API documentation](https://api-docs.igdb.com/#account-creation). When registering your application in the Twitch Developer Portal, fill out the form like so:

- Name: Something **unique or random** like `correct-horse-battery-staple` or `KVV8NDXMSRFJ2MRNPNRSL7GQT`
- OAuth Redirect URLs: `localhost`
- Category: `Application Integration`
- Client Type: `Confidential`

!!! important  
    The name you pick has to be unique! Picking an existing name will fail silently, with no error messages. We recommend using `romm-<random hash>`, like `romm-3fca6fd7f94dea4a05d029f654c0c44b`

Note the client ID and secret that appear on screen, and use them to set `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` and `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` in your environment variables.
