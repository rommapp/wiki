# Overview

This is the official documentation for [RomM](https://romm.app/), the beautiful, powerful self-hosted ROM manager and player. Here you'll find everything you need to know about setting up, configuring, and using RomM.

## Building the documentation

We use `uv` to build the documentation. To install it, run:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Then install python and the required dependencies:

```sh
uv install python
uv sync --all-extras --dev
```

Finally run the following command to serve the documentation from a local server:

```sh
uv run mkdocs serve [-a ip:port] --livereload
```

## Contributing

We welcome all types of contributions, from simple typo fixes to new content. If you'd like to contribute, please read our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Setting up the linter

We use [Trunk](https://trunk.io) for linting, which combines multiple linters with sensible defaults and a single configuration file. You'll need to install the Trunk CLI to use it.

#### - Install the Trunk CLI

```sh
curl https://get.trunk.io -fsSL | bash
```

Alternative installation methods can be found [here](https://docs.trunk.io/check/usage#install-the-cli). On commit, the linter will run automatically. To run it manually, use the following commands:

```sh
trunk fmt
trunk check
```

## Deploy

We use [mike]() to build and deploy documentation versions. Manually deploy a version needs to update and push the specific version (or a new one if creating a new version) with the following command:

```sh
uv run mike deploy --push <version> [alias]
```

This will update the `gh-pages` branch and automatically deploys the version with the fix/update to https://docs.romm.app
