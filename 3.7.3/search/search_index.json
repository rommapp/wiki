For example, <code>pocket-challenge-v2</code> would map to <code>Pocket Challenge V2</code>, and display the default platform icon in the app.</p> <p>Furthermore, only a portion of the supported platforms have custom icons built-in. If your library has platforms that aren't listed in the platforms icons list, RomM will display a default fallback icon.</p> <p>If you'd like to load your own custom icons for missing platforms, you can mount <code>/var/www/html/assets/platforms</code> to some local folder and place all of your custom <code>.ico</code> platform icons in there.

If you'd like to use your own icons for platforms already supported by RomM, just replace the file with another using the exact same name.</p> <p>The name of the <code>.ico</code> file should match the slug of the platform on IGDB.
