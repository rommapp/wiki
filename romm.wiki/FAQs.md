### Why is not PSP emulation enabled if emulatorjs supports it?

PSP emulation with the PPSSPP core requires special setup with a reverse proxy, or launching Chrome browser with the ``--disable-web-security`` and ``--enable-features=SharedArrayBuffer`` flags, which **WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE** as it disables important security features.
